step 1: install git

step 2: after install git first thing that we should do is set username and email address. 

when we use Git to make changes to our project's files, Git users this information to identify who made these changes. Git has a tool call ed git config that allows you to set configurations to Git. so to set a username:

git config --global user.name "ying Chen"

git config --global user.email "ying.chen@dpi.nc.gov"

git config --list

git help

now it's time for you to add Git to your projrct:

this is done by initializing a new Git repository.

A Git repository which is often abbreviated as just repo, is virual storage of your project. in other words, each project in Git is referenced as a repository

To initialize a new project or a project that already exists, 

cd to project folder 

git init


after init cmd if you add new files to projet need run 

git add . 

this cmd will add all of these files to our staging area.

then type:

git commit -m "first commit"
